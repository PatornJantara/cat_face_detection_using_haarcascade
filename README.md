This project i got inpiration from  
[pyimagesearch/Detecting cats in images with OpenCV(https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/06/20/detecting-cats-in-images-with-opencv/) 
<br /> I have adapt code for easily utilizing. Detecting objects using haar cascade seems not work in practical uses. <br />
if you try to use this method for real-timedetection. The main problem is low precision and accuracy. <br />
It always occurs when noise object hiding your target object. You can fix it by adjusting detectMultiScale  <br /> <br />
