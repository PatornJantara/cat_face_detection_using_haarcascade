# cat_face_detection_using_haarcascade
- **Requirements**
  - OpenCV
<br />
This project i got inspiration from  Pyimagesearch and I have adapted code for easily utilizing.
Detecting objects using haar cascade seems not work in practical uses. if you try to use this method for real-time detection. The main problem is low precision and accuracy. It always occurs when noise object hiding your target object. You can fix it by adjusting detectMultiScale
